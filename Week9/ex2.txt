To increase Hit/Miss ratio, we need to decrease the number of page references between the references to the same pages. To be precise, this number should not exceed the number of free page frames. If so, the page references will be processed without page faults since the referenced pages are already in memory.
For a given input file, we can increase the ratio a bit by rearranging the page references order. There are two references for page 4, 6, 7, etc. We can get these pairs of references as close as possible to increase the probability of the hit.
However, due to high variance of the referenced pages in the given input, my simulator shows the same ratio (0.019368 = 19 hits / 981 misses) when number of page frames is more than 16 (the number of bits per page frame). This happens because there are only 19 cases throughout the whole input file when the referenced page is already in memory. Increasing the number of page frame bits leads to increasing the number of hits, and, therefore, increasing the ratio.
